RIALTO is a scholarship & research output and impact data aggregator and dashboard for the Stanford University campus to use. At core, RIALTO is a Stanford researcher and research intelligence social graph.

RIALTO is a multi-phase project. This first phase and related development work cycle (started in 2018 April) focuses on data aggregation, normalization, enhancements, and publication (either for programmatic use or a web UI). Later phases may look into more web UI reports and visualizations, faculty or entity profiles, a data aggregation pipeline administrative interface, and adding new or enhanced data sources.

Technically, RIALTO is a data aggregation system leveraging a data ETL pipeline, a canonical datastore system based on a graph store with a subset of the VIVO-ISF ontology as RDF, and a simple web application serving up basic search and view functionalities from materializations of that data.
